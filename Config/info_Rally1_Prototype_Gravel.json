  "Description":"After the end of 17-21 WRC+ era, 22 Rally1 regulation is a new start for top level WRC. In order to create a competitive car, a pre-season prototype variant is built for testing. This prototype is using existing monocoque chassis, suspension and engine for cost reduction, added with a dummy hybrid unit to evaluate mechanical changes. Wheelbase has been increased to about 2600mm. Gravel damper is developed with exisiting MSR85 but limited travel to 270mm. After switching to space frame FIA safety cell, further development is needed.",
