  "Description":"After the end of 17-21 WRC+ era, 22 Rally1 regulation is a new start for top level WRC. In order to create a competitive car, a pre-season prototype variant is built for testing. This prototype is using existing monocoque chassis, suspension and engine for cost reduction, added with a dummy hybrid unit to evaluate mechanical changes. Wheelbase has been increased to about 2600mm. Tarmac dampers are mostly remain unchanged for now, but with a lower mounting point for higher ground clearance and more rake. After switching to space frame FIA safety cell, further development is needed.",
