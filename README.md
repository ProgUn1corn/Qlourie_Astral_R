# Qlourie Astral R
My personal BeamNG mod project with some simple Lua codes.

It comes from Automation, I made the car in Automation and rewrote almost everything's Jbeam by myself so the physics are completely new. The project started at about 2022/7, and this Github repo is created at 2024/1/16.

# What Is It
This mod is inspired by the World Rally Championship (WRC). While the vanilla game features the Vivace, it doesnâ€™t fully adhere to the actual WRC regulations concerning aspects such as weight and the center differential, suspension design and WRC aero bodykits. My goal is to craft a WRC car that complies with the 2017-2021 WRC regulations and to simulate the physics with as realistic as possible. This car will participate BRC, BeamNG Rally Championship. At the very least, the suspension system will offer a more authentic feel compared to rally cars in the game.

Also, there will be a Rally2 variant and a World RX RX1 variant, since they share some similarities.

# How to Use This Repo
## What's in this repo?
This repo contains engine sound files, all Jbeam files, and Lua files. I will create engine sound with FMOD, update Jbeam files when something is refined, and start to write lua codes for active center differential, launch control and potentially new detection method for LRS.
## How to make it your mod?
I'm not very familiar with Github, but I know Github can't store empty folders, so maybe it's not the best idea to upload everything because there are lot's of empty folders. The reason I'm using Github is tracking of Jbeam edits and Lua writing. 

However you can update yourself if there's something you want to, manually download files and the folder structure should look like this:

**Configs: BeamNG Userdata\version\mods\unpacked\un1corn_qlourie_astral_r\vehicles\qlourie_astral_r\files**

**Jbeam: BeamNG Userdata\version\mods\unpacked\un1corn_qlourie_astral_r\vehicles\qlourie_astral_r\body and engine\files**

**Lua: BeamNG Userdata\version\mods\unpacked\un1corn_qlourie_astral_r\vehicles\qlourie_astral_r\Lua\files**

**Engine Sound: BeamNG Userdata\version\mods\unpacked\un1corn_qlourie_astral_r\art\sound\blends and engine and shift\files**

Alternatively, you can download releases for pre-release test, and eventually I will upload to BeamNG's mod repo for free.

# Things to Remind
I have a main work and it's quite busy, so I can't take my time fully on this project. As experimenting and testing Jbeam properties are quite heavy work, there are some imperfections. Also, I've found it's not worth to dig deeper with Automation model as there are tons of hassle with opacity map and mesh overlap, this mod will be at where it is. I'm not planning to make the model more detailed or get whole Jbeam design revamped.

However I'm really looking forward to build a new car from the ground up. I'm learning sketching and I plan to make a new car in Blender, at that time it will have it's road counterpart also Rally4, Rally2 variant. I'm really looking forward to it.

Also some fiction brands and sponsors! There is actually now in the mod by Automation modders but I'm planning to make my own original sponsors.

# Existing Problems (that are mostly not going to be fixed)
- Due to insufficient chassis Jbeam noding, in rare cases you may encounter chassis vibration.
- All colors and materials are none adjustable, the color theme is fixed. (You can manually adjust in Material Editor though, but it's not RGB image so no simple way to change color)
- Due to the way Automation exports (when I exported), all decals and skins are actual models instead of decal image. This means the skin and decal will sometimes clip through car model. Also, it will take more space to load
- Also because of UV is messed, sometimes there are messed up textures due to modified mesh.
- Meshes are still Automation level so it may not be comparable to a full fledged mod
- Flexbody animations are not perfect, especially around engine and transmission, it just works but it's not accurate
