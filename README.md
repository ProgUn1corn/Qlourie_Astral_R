# Qlourie_Astral_R
My personal BeamNG mod project with some simple Lua codes.

It comes from Automation, I made the car in Automation and rewrote almost everything's Jbeam by myself so the physics are completely new. The project started at about 2022/8/30, and this Github repo is created at 2024/1/16.

# What is it
This mod is inspired by the World Rally Championship (WRC). While the vanilla game features the Vivace, it doesnâ€™t fully adhere to the actual WRC regulations concerning aspects such as weight and the center differential, and real WRC bodykits. My goal is to craft a WRC car that complies with the 2017-2021 WRC regulations and to simulate the physics with as realistic as possible. At the very least, the suspension system will offer a more authentic feel compared to rally cars in the game.

# Features
## Chassis
- 2.565m wheelbase and 1.875m track width
- 1190KG without crew and spare wheel
- 1360KG with driver and co-driver and one spare wheel
- 20KG per tarmac wheel and 25kg per gravel wheel, node weight calculated based on the rim weight limit as specified by WRC regulations
- Separated parts from Automation model for better deformation and animation
## Engine and Transmission
- 380HP at 6500RPM, 430Nm at 5000-6000RPM
- 6 speed sequential transmission
- Front and rear adjustable LSD
- Active center differential in response to steering and throttle input (**WIP**)
- Steering wheel and pedal shifter animation
- 
## Aerodynamics
- Front and rear independent aerodynamics
- Front lip and rear diffuser react to ground clearance change
- Total about 400kg of downforce at 200km/h
